=== Stateless Communication

*Definition:*
In REST, each request from the client to the server must contain all the information the server needs to fulfill that request. The server does *not store any client context* between requests.

*Why it matters:*
This makes the system scalable, as servers don’t need to remember session state.

*Example:*
Let’s say you’re making two API calls:

1. `GET /users/101`
2. `POST /users/101/orders` with body:

```json
{
  "item": "Laptop",
  "quantity": 1
}
```

*Stateless behavior:*
The second request doesn’t assume the server knows who the user is from the first request. It contains everything it needs: the user ID is in the URL (`/users/101`), and the order details are in the body.

---

=== Uniform Resource

*Definition:*

REST uses a *uniform interface* for accessing resources. Each resource is identified by a *URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)*. It also uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).

*Why it matters:*
It simplifies and decouples the architecture. Clients don't need to know how the server works internally.

*Example:*
For a book store API, these could be URIs:

* `GET /books` → List all books
* `GET /books/10` → Get details of book with ID 10
* `DELETE /books/10` → Delete book 10

Each URI is a unique identifier for a *resource*.

---

=== Resource-Based

*Definition:*

In REST, everything is considered a *resource*. A resource could be a user, an order, a product, etc. Resources are represented as JSON or XML, and are accessed using standard methods.

*Why it matters:*
It focuses on *nouns* (like `/books`, `/users`) instead of *verbs* (like `/getBook`, `/createUser`).

*Example:*

Instead of this RPC-style (non-RESTful):

```
GET /getUser?id=101
POST /createOrder?user=101
```

You use resource-based REST-style:

```
GET /users/101
POST /users/101/orders
```

####################

The REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture is defined by a set of *architectural constraints*. These constraints guide how web services should be designed to be scalable, maintainable, and performant.

There are *6 REST architectural constraints*:

---

== REST Architectural Constraints

=== Client-Server

*Separation of concerns between client and server.*

* The *client* handles the user interface.
* The *server* manages data and business logic.

*Benefit:* Improves portability and scalability.

*Example:*
A mobile app (client) sends a request to `https://api.example.com/users/1`, and the server sends back the data.

---

=== Stateless

*Each request from client to server must contain all necessary information to understand and process the request.*

* No session is stored on the server.
* Each request is independent.

*Benefit:* Simplifies server design and improves scalability.

*Example:*
Every API call includes authentication tokens and necessary data, like:

```http
GET /orders
Authorization: Bearer abc123
```

---

=== Cacheable

*Responses must define whether they are cacheable or not.*

* Helps improve performance.
* Reduces unnecessary server calls.

*Benefit:* Optimizes network efficiency and reduces server load.

*Example:*
Response header:

```http
Cache-Control: max-age=3600
```

Allows the client to cache the response for 1 hour.

---

=== Uniform Interface

*REST relies on a consistent, standardized interface for communication.*

Key principles:

* Use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Use resource URIs
* Use standard media types (like JSON)
* Stateless communication

*Benefit:* Simplifies interactions between client and server.

*Example:*

```
GET /users/123
POST /users
DELETE /users/123
```

---

=== Layered System

*A REST API can be composed of multiple layers (e.g., security, load balancing, caching), and each layer doesn't know about the other layers.*

*Benefit:* Improves flexibility and scalability.

*Example:*
A request may pass through a load balancer, authentication server, and cache before reaching the API server.

---

=== Code on Demand (optional)

*Servers can provide code (usually JavaScript) that clients can execute.*

*Benefit:* Extends client functionality on the fly.

*Example:*
Server returns a JavaScript snippet that adds dynamic behavior to a web app.

```html
<script src="https://api.example.com/widgets/button.js"></script>
```

---


== RESTful URL Design Best Practices

=== Resource Naming

*Definition:*
In REST, resources (like users, products, orders) should be named using *nouns*, not verbs.

*Best Practices:*

* Use *plural nouns*
* Use *lowercase*
* Use *hyphens* for readability
* Avoid using actions like `get` or `create` in the URL

*Examples:*

```
GET /users           → Get all users
GET /users/101       → Get user with ID 101
POST /orders         → Create a new order
DELETE /orders/55    → Delete order with ID 55
```

Avoid doing this:

```
GET /getUser?id=101     ✗
POST /createOrder       ✗
```

---

=== Path Parameters

*Definition:*
*Path parameters* are variables within the path of the URL and are used to identify a *specific resource*.

*Syntax:* `/resource/{id}`

*Examples:*

```
GET /books/123        → Get the book with ID 123
PUT /users/45         → Update user with ID 45
DELETE /orders/22     → Delete order with ID 22
```

Here, `123`, `45`, and `22` are *path parameters*.

---

=== Query Parameters

*Definition:*
*Query parameters* are used to *filter or sort* results and are not part of the resource path.

*Syntax:* `/resource?key=value`

*Examples:*

```
GET /books?author=John
GET /books?genre=fiction&sort=title
GET /users?age=30&country=India
```

Here, `author`, `genre`, `sort`, `age`, and `country` are *query parameters* used to refine the results.

---

=== API Versioning

*Definition:*
*API versioning* helps manage changes to an API over time without breaking existing clients.

*Common Approaches:*

*URI Versioning* (most common)

```
GET /v1/users
GET /v2/users
```

*Header Versioning*

```
GET /users
Header: Accept-Version: v1
```

*Query Parameter Versioning*

```
GET /users?version=1
```

== Response Codes and Error Handling

=== Success Codes (2xx)

These indicate the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Code | Meaning | Description
| 200  | OK      | The request was successful
| 201  | Created | Resource was successfully created
| 204  | No Content | Request succeeded but there’s no response body
|===

.Examples:
----
GET /users/5     → 200 OK (with user data)
POST /books      → 201 Created (new book added)
DELETE /orders/9 → 204 No Content (order deleted)
----

=== Client Error Codes (4xx)

These indicate the client sent a bad request or doesn't have the right permissions.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Code | Meaning | Description
| 400  | Bad Request  | Invalid data sent by client
| 401  | Unauthorized | Missing or invalid authentication
| 403  | Forbidden    | Authenticated but not allowed
| 404  | Not Found    | Resource not found
| 409  | Conflict     | Resource conflict (e.g. duplicate entry)
|===

.Examples:
----
GET /users/9999   → 404 Not Found
POST /books       → 400 Bad Request (if required field is missing)
DELETE /admin/5   → 403 Forbidden (if user lacks permission)
----

=== Server Error Codes (5xx)

These indicate a failure on the server side while processing the request.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Code | Meaning | Description
| 500  | Internal Server Error | Server failed to handle the request
| 502  | Bad Gateway           | Invalid response from upstream server
| 503  | Service Unavailable   | Server is down or overloaded
|===

.Example:
----
GET /books → 500 Internal Server Error (e.g. database crash)
----

=== Error Handling Best Practices

* Use proper HTTP status codes.
* Return a JSON body with helpful error messages.
* Don’t expose internal server details to the client.

.Example Error Response (400 Bad Request):
[source, json]
----
{
  "status": 400,
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "Missing required field: 'title'"
}
----

.Example Error Response (404 Not Found):
[source, json]
----
{
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "User with ID 999 not found"
}
----

=== Summary Table

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Status Code | Type         | Description
| 200         | Success      | OK
| 201         | Success      | Created
| 204         | Success      | No Content
| 400         | Client Error | Bad Request
| 401         | Client Error | Unauthorized

| 500         | Server Error | Internal Server Error
| 503         | Server Error | Service Unavailable
|===


== Request and Response Headers

==== Request Headers

These are sent by the client (like a browser or app) to provide extra information about the request.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Header | Purpose | Example
| Content-Type | Tells the server the format of the data being sent | application/json
| Authorization | Sends credentials (like token or API key) | Bearer abc123token
| Accept | Tells the server what format the client can accept | application/json, application/xml
| User-Agent | Identifies the client (browser, app, etc.) | Mozilla/5.0
| Host | Specifies the domain name of the server | example.com
| Cache-Control | Controls caching behavior | no-cache, max-age=3600
|===

==== Response Headers

These are sent by the server to give information about the response.

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Header | Purpose | Example
| Content-Type | Tells the client the format of the returned data | application/json
| Content-Length | Size of the response body in bytes | 348
| Cache-Control | Instructs client/browser how to cache the data | no-store, max-age=600
| ETag | Identifier for version of resource (used for caching) | "abc123"
| Set-Cookie | Sends a cookie to be stored on the client | sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly
| Access-Control-Allow-Origin | Used for CORS (cross-origin requests) | *, https://example.com
|===

==== Example Request

[source, http]
----

{
  "title": "The Alchemist",
  "author": "Paulo Coelho"
}
----

==== Example Response

[source, http]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 75
Cache-Control: no-store
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

{
  "id": 101,
  "title": "The Alchemist",
  "author": "Paulo Coelho"

== JSON Jackson Data Binding

Jackson is a popular Java library used to convert between Java objects and JSON data.
This process is called *data binding*.

==== Types of Data Binding

* *Simple Data Binding*: Converts JSON to basic Java types like `Map`, `List`, `String`, etc.
* *Full Data Binding*: Converts JSON to custom Java objects (POJOs) and vice versa.

The main class used for this is `ObjectMapper` from the Jackson library.

==== Example: Convert JSON to Java Object and Back

===== 1. Java POJO Class

[source,java]
----
public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private double price;

    // Getters and setters
    public String getTitle() { return title; }
    public void setTitle(String title) { this.title = title; }

    public String getAuthor() { return author; }
    public void setAuthor(String author) { this.author = author; }

    public double getPrice() { return price; }
    public void setPrice(double price) { this.price = price; }
}
----

===== 2. Convert JSON String to Java Object

[source,java]
----
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class JsonToJavaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String json = "{ \"title\": \"The Alchemist\", \"author\": \"Paulo Coelho\", \"price\": 9.99 }";

        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        Book book = mapper.readValue(json, Book.class);

        System.out.println(book.getTitle());  // Output: The Alchemist
    }
}
----

===== 3. Convert Java Object to JSON String

[source,java]
----
import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;

public class JavaToJsonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Book book = new Book();
        book.setTitle("The Alchemist");
        book.setAuthor("Paulo Coelho");
        book.setPrice(9.99);

        ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
        String jsonString = mapper.writeValueAsString(book);

        System.out.println(jsonString);
        // Output: {"title":"The Alchemist","author":"Paulo Coelho","price":9.99}
    }
}
----

==== Maven Dependency

If you're using Maven, add this to your `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.2</version>
</dependency>
----

##########################

== Jackson in Spring Boot

Spring Boot has *built-in support* for Jackson — no need to add the dependency manually in most cases.

==== How It Works

* Spring Boot includes Jackson automatically through the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency.
* It uses Jackson's `ObjectMapper`:
** To serialize Java objects into JSON (for responses).
** To deserialize JSON into Java objects (for requests).

==== Example REST Controller

[source,java]
----
@RestController
public class BookController {

    @PostMapping("/books")
    public String createBook(@RequestBody Book book) {
        return "Book received: " + book.getTitle();
    }

    @GetMapping("/book")
    public Book getBook() {
        Book book = new Book();
        book.setTitle("The Alchemist");
        book.setAuthor("Paulo Coelho");
        book.setPrice(9.99);
        return book; // Automatically converted to JSON by Jackson
    }
}
----

* `@RequestBody` → Jackson deserializes JSON to `Book` object.
* Return value → Jackson serializes `Book` object to JSON.

==== Do You Need to Add Jackson Manually?

No. If you use the following dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Then Jackson (`jackson-databind`) is included by default.
