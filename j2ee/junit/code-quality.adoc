== Introduction

* *Code Quality* means writing clean, readable, efficient, and maintainable code.
* Good quality code reduces bugs, improves collaboration, and makes applications easier to extend.
* Code quality is *not optional* in professional Java development.

== Key Code Quality Principles

* *Readability*: Code should be easy to read and understand.
* *Maintainability*: Code should be easy to update and fix.
* *Simplicity*: Solve problems with the simplest possible solution.
* *Consistency*: Use consistent naming, formatting, and structure.
* *Performance*: Write efficient code but not at the cost of readability unless necessary.
* *Testability*: Code should be easy to test (prefer small, modular methods).

== Naming Conventions

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
public class employeeDetails {
    public void CalculateSalary() { }
    private int EMPLOYEEage;
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
public class EmployeeDetails {
    public void calculateSalary() { }
    private int employeeAge;
}
----

== Code Structure and Organization

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
public class EmployeeService {
    // Handles login
    // Calculates salary
    // Processes leaves
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
public class LoginService { }
public class SalaryService { }
public class LeaveService { }
----

*One class = one responsibility.*

== Commenting and Documentation

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
// This method adds two numbers
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
/**
 * Adds two integers.
 *
 * @param a first number
 * @param b second number
 * @return sum of a and b
 */
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
----

*Prefer Javadoc for method descriptions.*

== Code Formatting

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
if(condition)
{
System.out.println("Hello");
}
else
{
System.out.println("Bye");
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
if (condition) {
    System.out.println("Hello");
} else {
    System.out.println("Bye");
}
----

*Follow consistent brace placement and indentation.*

== Error Handling

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
try {
    FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt");
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Ignored
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
try (FileReader reader = new FileReader("file.txt")) {
    // process file
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("File could not be read: " + e.getMessage());
}
----

*Catch specific exceptions and clean resources properly.*

== Best Practices

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
public class Service {
    Database db = new Database(); // Tight coupling
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
public class Service {
    private Database db;

    public Service(Database db) {
        this.db = db;
    }
}
----

*Use dependency injection for better flexibility and testability.*

== Avoid Magic Numbers

=== Wrong Code

[source, java]
----
public double calculateBonus(double salary) {
    return salary * 0.2;
}
----

=== Corrected Code

[source, java]
----
private static final double BONUS_PERCENTAGE = 0.2;

public double calculateBonus(double salary) {
    return salary * BONUS_PERCENTAGE;
}
----

*Use named constants instead of hardcoded values.*

== Code Review Standards

* Ensure every code change is reviewed by peers.
* Look for:
** Logic correctness
** Security vulnerabilities
** Performance bottlenecks
** Readability and simplicity
* Keep a *constructive* tone during code reviews.

== Tools for Ensuring Code Quality

* *Checkstyle*: Enforces coding standards.
* *PMD*: Detects bad coding practices.
* *FindBugs* or *SpotBugs*: Finds potential bugs.
* *SonarQube*: Comprehensive static code analysis.
* *Jacoco*: Measures test coverage.

== Code Smells to Avoid

* Large classes (God Object)
* Long methods (more than 20â€“30 lines)
* Duplicate code
* Excessive parameters in methods
* Overuse of static methods
* Tight coupling between classes

=== Example of Code Smell: Long Method

[source, java]
----
// BAD: Too much in one method
public void processEmployee() {
    validateEmployee();
    saveEmployee();
    sendEmail();
    logActivity();
}
----

=== Refactored Code

[source, java]
----
public void processEmployee() {
    validateEmployee();
    saveEmployee();
    notifyEmployee();
    auditActivity();
}

private void notifyEmployee() {
    sendEmail();
}

private void auditActivity() {
    logActivity();
}
----

== Final Tips

* Always think about the next developer who will read your code.
* Aim for clarity first, optimization second.
* Consistently refactor code to improve quality over time.
