== What is React

* React is a library for building modern single page applications (*SPAs*).
* In traditional applications, each user action causes a full HTML page reload.
* In SPAs, only partial page updates are made based on user actions, without full reloads.
* SPAs communicate with back-end servers using REST APIs to send and retrieve data.

---

* Examples of SPAs:
** Google Maps and Yahoo Maps – update maps dynamically.
** Gmail and Yahoo Mail – update the interface without full page reloads.
* React helps build SPAs with partial updates and REST API communication.
* A future project example: a full stack app with React (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend).

---

* Companies using React include:
** Dropbox
** WhatsApp
** Facebook (React was originally developed at Facebook)
* For more examples, you can visit: `madewithreact.com`

---

* DIY(Do It Yourself) Approach:
** Using vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax could work for small apps.
** For enterprise apps, managing features like data binding becomes hard.
** Libraries like React, Angular, and Vue handle the heavy lifting, making development easier and scalable.
