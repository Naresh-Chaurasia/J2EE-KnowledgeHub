* *Introduction to Spring Framework*

* *Objective:* Understand key concepts of Spring Framework, including IoC, Dependency Injection, and Bean Management.

##############################################

=== Basic Terminologies

Here are simple definitions for each of the listed Spring Framework concepts:

---

*@Beans*

A *@Bean* is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC container. It is created, configured, and assembled by Spring.

---

*@Configuration*

*@Configuration* is an annotation in Spring used to mark a class as a source of bean definitions. It tells Spring that the class contains one or more @Bean methods and should be processed by the Spring container to generate and manage Spring Beans.

---

*Autowiring*

*Autowiring* is a feature in Spring that automatically injects the required dependencies into a bean by matching types or names, without needing explicit configuration.

---

*Dependency Injection*

*Dependency Injection* is a design pattern where one object supplies the dependencies (other objects it needs) to another object. In Spring, this means the container provides the required objects to your classes.

---

*Inversion of Control*

*Inversion of Control (IoC)* is a principle where the control of object creation and management is given to the framework (Spring), instead of being handled in user code.

---

*IOC Container*

The *IoC Container* is a part of the Spring Framework that implements IoC. It manages the lifecycle, configuration, and dependencies of beans.

---

*Application Context*

The *ApplicationContext* is a Spring interface that represents the IoC container. It provides methods to get beans, load configuration files, and manage the application lifecycle.

---

*@Repository*

*@Repository* is a specialization of the @Component annotation used to indicate that the class provides CRUD operations and interacts with the database. Spring automatically translates database-related exceptions in classes marked with this annotation.

---

*@Configuration*

*@Configuration* marks a class as a source of bean definitions. It is used to define beans using @Bean methods

---

*@ComponentScan*

*@ComponentScan* tells Spring where to look for components (@Component, @Service, @Repository, etc.) to register as beans automatically.

##############################################

=== Inversion of Control (IoC)?

* *Definition:*
* IoC is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is handed over to a container (Spring Framework).
* Helps in reducing tight coupling and improving testability.

==== Loose Coupling: Sorting

---

Loose coupling means that classes or modules are *independent* and can be modified or replaced *without affecting* other parts of the system.

---

*Scenario: Sorting Strategies with Loose Coupling*

We create an *interface* that defines a sorting behavior. Different sorting algorithms will implement this interface.

*Step 1: Define the Interface*

```java
public interface SortAlgorithm {
    void sort(int[] numbers);
}
```
This interface defines a method `sort()`, which different sorting algorithms will implement.

---

*Step 2: Implement Different Sorting Algorithms*

*Bubble Sort Implementation*

```java
@Component
public class BubbleSort implements SortAlgorithm {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {
    }
}
```

*Quick Sort Implementation*

```java
@Component
public class QuickSort implements SortAlgorithm {
    @Override
    public void sort(int[] numbers) {

    }
}
```

---

*Step 3: Create a Service That Uses the Sorting Algorithm*

```java
@Component
public class SortService {
    private final SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;

    @Autowired
    public SortService(SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm) {
        this.sortAlgorithm = sortAlgorithm;
    }

    public void performSorting(int[] numbers) {
        sortAlgorithm.sort(numbers);
    }
}
```

* The `SortService` *depends on* `SortAlgorithm` but does not know which sorting algorithm it is using.
* Spring *injects* the required sorting algorithm at runtime, ensuring *loose coupling*.

---

*Step 4: Configure Sorting Algorithm in Spring*

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
    @Bean
    public SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm() {
        return new BubbleSort(); // Can be changed to QuickSort easily
    }
}
```

* If we change `BubbleSort` to `QuickSort`, the system will work *without modifying `SortService`*.

---

*Key Benefits of Loose Coupling*

* *Easier to extend*: We can add new sorting algorithms without modifying `SortService`.
* *Improved flexibility*: We can switch sorting strategies at runtime.
* *Better maintainability*: The classes are independent and reusable.

This is how *loose coupling* makes systems *more scalable and maintainable*! ðŸš€

==== Scenario: Chef

Imagine you love eating delicious home-cooked food but don't have time to cook. You have two choices:

*Without IoC (Traditional Approach)*

* You go grocery shopping.
* You buy ingredients.
* You cook the meal yourself.
* You serve it and clean up after.

*Problem:* You control every step, making it time-consuming and tightly coupled to your effort.

*With IoC (Using a Chef - Inversion of Control)*

* You *hire a personal chef* and tell them what kind of food you want.
* The chef *takes care of* buying ingredients, cooking, and serving.
* You simply enjoy the meal.

*IoC Concept:* Instead of *you controlling the process*, the *chef takes control* of cooking.

---

##############################################

*How This Relates to Spring Framework?*

* In a traditional Java application, we *create and manage objects ourselves* (like cooking on our own).
* With IoC, *Spring takes over object creation and management*, just like a chef handling the cooking.
* We just *request what we need* (like ordering a dish), and Spring *provides the required object* (like a cooked meal).

##############################################

=== Dependency Injection

* Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique where one object supplies dependencies of another object.

* Types of DI:
** Constructor Injection
** Setter Injection
** Field Injection

##############################################

```java
//Constructor Injection
@Component
public class Car {
private Engine engine;

      @Autowired
      public Car(Engine engine) {
          this.engine = engine;
      }
  }
```

---

##############################################


```java
//Setter Injection
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;
    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

---

##############################################

```java
//Field Injection
@Component
public class Car {
    @Autowired
    private Engine engine;
}
```

---

##############################################

*Component Scanning*

* *Definition:*
* Spring automatically detects and registers beans using `@ComponentScan`.
* Requires annotating classes with `@Component`, `@Service`, or `@Repository`.

* *Example:*

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

---

##############################################

*Qualifiers Overview*

* *Definition:*
* Used to specify which bean to inject when multiple beans of the same type exist.

* *Example:*
```java
@Component("dieselEngine")
public class DieselEngine implements Engine {}

@Component("petrolEngine")
public class PetrolEngine implements Engine {}

@Component
public class Car {
  private Engine engine;

  @Autowired
  public Car(@Qualifier("dieselEngine") Engine engine) {
      this.engine = engine;
  }
}
```

---

##############################################


=== Bean Scopes

* *Definition:*
* Spring provides different bean scopes:
* `singleton` (default)
* `prototype`
* `request`, `session`, `application` (Web only)

* *Example:*

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class PrototypeBean {
}
```

---

=== Bean Lifecycle

The *Spring Bean Lifecycle* is the process a bean follows within the Spring container:

* Spring creates the bean instance.
* It injects dependencies (sets properties).
* It applies any lifecycle callbacks like `@PostConstruct`, `afterPropertiesSet()`, or custom init methods.
* The bean is ready for use.
* When the application shuts down, Spring calls destroy methods like `@PreDestroy`, `destroy()`, or custom destroy methods.

This lifecycle ensures proper initialization and cleanup of resources.


---

=== Java Config Bean

* *Definition:*
* Instead of XML, Java-based configuration defines beans using `@Configuration` and `@Bean`.

* *Example:*
```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
@Bean
public Engine engine() {
return new Engine();
}
}
```

=== What is AOP?

*Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)* helps you separate cross-cutting concerns (like logging, security, transactions) from your main business logic.

For example, instead of writing logging code in every method, you write it **once** in an "Aspect" and apply it **where needed**.

---

*Key AOP Concepts*

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Concept | Description

| *Aspect*
| A class that contains cross-cutting logic (e.g., logging).

| *Advice*
| The code to be executed at a join point (e.g., before a method runs).

| *Join Point*
| A point in the execution of your program (like a method call).

| *Pointcut*
| An expression that matches join points (e.g., all methods in a package).
|===


---

*Maven Dependency*

To use AOP in Spring, add this to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-aop</artifactId>
    <version>6.1.4</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
    <artifactId>aspectjweaver</artifactId>
    <version>1.9.21.1</version>
</dependency>
```
