== Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka

Eureka is a *service discovery* tool from Netflix, integrated with Spring Cloud.

* It acts as a *Service Registry*.
* Each microservice registers itself with Eureka at startup.
* Other services use Eureka to discover registered services by name (instead of hard-coded IPs).
* Helps with dynamic scaling and failover of microservices.

Typical Components:

- *Eureka Server*: Central registry of all services.
- *Eureka Client*: Microservices that register with the server.

Benefits:

* Enables load-balanced service-to-service communication.
* Automatically removes failed services after a timeout.

== Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

Spring Cloud LoadBalancer is a *client-side load-balancer* that helps to distribute the load across multiple instances of a service.

* Replaces Netflix Ribbon (deprecated).
* Works with service discovery (like Eureka).
* Uses round-robin by default, but strategy can be customized.

Benefits:

* Fault-tolerance: If one service instance fails, request goes to another.
* Better resource utilization.

Example Flow:

1. User service sends request to `order-service`.
2. Spring Cloud LoadBalancer fetches all available instances from Eureka.
3. Chooses one instance using load balancing strategy.
4. Forwards the request.

== Spring Cloud API Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway provides a *single entry point* for all client requests to microservices.

* Routes incoming requests to the appropriate service.
* Can perform filtering, authentication, logging, rate-limiting, etc.
* Built on Project Reactor (supports asynchronous and reactive programming).

Key Features:

* Path-based routing (`/orders/**` â†’ Order Service).
* Filters for logging, security, transformation.
* Integrated with service discovery.

Benefits:

* Centralized control over routing.
* Improves security and maintainability.

== Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance ensures that the system continues to function even when parts of it fail.

Spring Cloud supports fault tolerance using:

* *Resilience4j*: A lightweight fault-tolerance library.
* Features include:
- *Circuit Breaker*: Prevents system overload by opening circuit when errors spike.
- *Retry*: Automatically retry failed requests.
- *Rate Limiter*: Limits number of requests to a service.
- *Bulkhead*: Isolates failures in parts of the system.

Example: If `payment-service` is down, the circuit breaker opens and returns a fallback response without calling the service.

== Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin

These tools provide *distributed tracing* for microservices.

* *Sleuth*: Adds trace and span IDs to requests so logs can be correlated across services.
* *Zipkin*: Collects and displays trace data in a UI.

Trace Flow:

1. Sleuth adds tracing information to logs and HTTP headers.
2. Zipkin gathers and visualizes request flows and timing.

Benefits:

* Helps identify performance bottlenecks.
* Makes debugging across services easier.

== Spring Cloud Config Server

Provides *centralized configuration management* for all microservices.

* Stores configurations in a Git repository or local file system.
* Config Server fetches and serves configuration to microservices at runtime.
* Supports multiple environments (dev, test, prod).

Benefits:

* Externalizes configuration from code.
* Consistency across services.
* Easy updates without restarting services.

Typical Setup:

1. Create `application.yml` or `application-{profile}.yml` files in Git.
2. Start Config Server and point it to Git repo.
3. Microservices fetch configuration from Config Server.
