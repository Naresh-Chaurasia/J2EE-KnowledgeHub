== CheckList

* [x] Notes in Github
* [x] PPT in one drive
* [x] PPT on Laptop
* [x] PPT to PDF

== Agile Simulation Assignment

*Build a Simple Product Using Scrum*

=== Objective
To simulate a real Agile environment using the Scrum framework and demonstrate understanding of Agile principles, roles, ceremonies, and artifacts.

=== Project Theme (Choose One)
Ask each team to pick one simple product idea. Some examples:

* A To-do List Web App
* A Simple Weather App
* A Book Catalog System
* A Recipe Manager
* A College Event Planner

(Or let them come up with their own idea, subject to approval)

=== Team Structure
Each team should have:

* 1 Product Owner
* 1 Scrum Master
* 2-4 Developers

Encourage rotation in roles across different teams if time allows.

=== Assignment Phases

==== 1. Product Vision and Backlog Creation
*Deliverables:* Product Vision Statement, Initial Product Backlog

* Define the product goal.
* Write at least 10-15 user stories with acceptance criteria.
* Prioritize the product backlog.

==== 2. Sprint Planning
*Deliverables:* Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog

* Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting.
* Select user stories for Sprint 1 (small scope — 1-week sprint recommended).
* Break stories into tasks.
* Estimate story points using Planning Poker.

==== 3. Sprint Execution
*Deliverables:* Daily Scrum notes/log (simulated)

* Simulate daily standups (they can document this on a shared sheet).
* Team works on implementing features (actual coding is optional or minimal).
* Create at least 1 “Increment” or mock-up.

==== 4. Sprint Review & Retrospective
*Deliverables:* Sprint Review presentation + Sprint Retrospective notes

* Showcase completed work (even if it's paper-based or design).
* Capture feedback.
* Reflect on what went well and what can be improved.

=== Agile Artifacts to Submit
Each team should submit:

. Product Vision
. Product Backlog
. Sprint Backlog for Sprint 1
. Burndown chart (simulated)
. Daily Scrum notes (brief entries)
. Sprint Review summary
. Sprint Retrospective summary
